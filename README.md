Help topics are the contextual categories that tickets are organized into. Organizing tickets this way makes them easier to understand and process.

On the same tab (Manage) go to Help Topics. 

The help topics that will be configured in addition to the defaults are:
- Business Critical Outage
- Personal Computer Issues
- Equipment Request
- Password Reset
